## Guidelines

In this exercise, you will use your knowledge to count the number of pedestrians in some pictures.

The pictures to analyze are in the folder `src/data`. For each of them, try to perform object detection to estimate the number of pedestrian on it.

You can of course reuse your code of the previous exercises.
