## Guidelines

This is the follow up of the optional exercise you made the dimensionality reduction day. You can download images of faces and emotions from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/emotion-detection-from-facial-expressions).

Select some of them (the dataset is quite big for a simple computer), and make a CNN to predict the emotions. Try to improve the score you had with classical Machine Learning a couple of weeks ago.
